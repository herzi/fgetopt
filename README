If you're lucky, the latest version of this software might be located at:
http://unlikely.org/code/fgetopt/

The fgetopt package is a drop-in replacement for getopt_long, except
that it's not quite as slick.  We are always "POSIXLY_CORRECT" because
we don't re-order non-option arguments so that they form a contiguous
block at the end of the list.  (Consequently, any "+" at the beginning
of your short option string is ignored.)  We also don't grok
abbreviated long option names.  And we don't do that "W;" thing where
"W;" in your short option string means treat "-W foo" means "--foo".
Neither do we recognize a "-" at the beginning of the short option
string as meaning to treat non-option argv-elements as if they were
the arguments of an option with character code 1.  I think everything
else is the same.

but I finally decided to slap a version number on it.
